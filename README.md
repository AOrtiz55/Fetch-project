# 🐶 Furry Finder: Dog Finder App

This application is modern React app that connects to a shelter API to help you discover **dogs in need of a home**. Search across listings, filter by breed, and sign in with a simple name/email flow. The UI is fast, responsive, and focused on getting you to “aww” as quickly as possible.
